# About

These color schemes are for PHPStorm 2.x. They are (to my knowledge)
complete for every language PHPStorm supports.
This theme from http://tedwise.com/2009/02/26/dark-pastels-theme-for-intellij-idea/

I recommend using the font "Consolas" with this color scheme.

# Installation

Go to Preferences -> Editor -> Colors and Fonts. Create a new color
scheme called "Dark Pastels" and another called "Dark Pastels".

Click Apply.

Search your hard drive for a file called "Dark Pastels.xml"

Replace that file and the one called "Dark Pastels.xml" with the ones
in my github repository.

On a Mac, you'll find that file at
`~/Library/Preferences/WebIDE10/colors/Dark Pastels.xml`

On a Linux that file is located at
`~/.WebIde10/config/colors/Dark Pastels.xml`

For Windows you're probably on your own. I don't know where
it would be stored.

# Why not package as a .jar?

Because frankly, I think that's a really crappy way of packaging things
and I won't support it. Sorry.
